How

I
have
a
parent
widget
A and a
child
widget
B, and the
user
has
the
capability
to
open and close
widget
B
from widget A.How
can
I
check is widget
B is closed ?

I
show
widget
B
using
the
show
command.

One
of
the
things
i
am
thinking
to
do is passing
a
variable
to
the
constructor
of
widget
B
then
update
its
value in the
CloseEvent, but
i
am
pretty
sure
there is an
easier
way.

Many
thanks in advance,

QWidget::isVisible()

You
can in closeEvent()
of
your
widget
B
emit
your
own
signal
widgetBClose() and then
connect
to
this
signal in widget
A and do
what
you
want in this
slot.

A
closed
QWidget is hidden(i.e.
not visible
on
screen) by
definition, so, as

@Kxyu


said, QWidget::isVisible()
can
indicate
whether
a
QWidget is closed.

QWidget::close() is basically
a
combination
of
QWidget::closeEvent(), QW
if Qt: :
    WA_DeleteOnClose is set).

Thank
you
all
for your responses.For

I
will
give
it
a
shot and see.Let’s
say
a
widget is open
but
covered
by
another
window, would
this
window
be
visible or not ?

Many
thanks,

Quoting
the
"doc of QWidget": http: //

bq.A
widget
that
happens
to
be
obscured
by
other
windows
on
the
screen is considered
to
be
visible.

The
"covered by another widget"
thing
only
happens
with widgets which
