# de_solver
solve 1'st order DEs using numerical methods

Im using some crutch to solve expressions very very fast: load code template, put expression in it, then write back into file, reload module & jit-compile method.

also i wanna implement other fun stuff like runge-kutta method, impr. euler method, error calcolation and so on
